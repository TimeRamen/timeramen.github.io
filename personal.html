						<h3>Hobbies</h3>
						<p>I enjoy reading books, watching shows and movies. Videogames are cool too.</p>
						<p>I also like drawing, writing code, playing chess and table tennis.</p>
						<div class="hidden extraContent">
							<h4>Books</h4>
							<p>Lord of the Flies for fiction, Boy: Tales of Childhood for non-fiction.</p>
							<p>I am currently reading Neuromancer by Willam Gibson, the so called birthplace of cyberpunk. I enjoy cyberpunk quite a lot and Neuromancer is no exception, although I do groan at the dated usages of the word "megabyte" strewn throughout the book.</p>
							<h4>Shows</h4>
							<p>Big fan of Always Sunny in Philadephia. I also like WonderShowzen. As for the animation department, Bojack Horseman is one that I found myself to recently be fond of.</p>
							<h4>Movies</h4>
							<p>I do not watch many movies, but if I had to pick a favourite it would either be between Seven Samurai, Fantastic Mr. Fox or Akira.</p>
							<h4>Comics</h4>
							<p>Invincible is the only western comic I've read from start to finish that is truly a satisfying journey from beginning to end. Saga comes close but it hasn't finished yet.</p>
							<p>As for japanese manga, Naoki Urasawa's 20th Century Boys and Monster are my favourites. Vagabond is also up there. Its a pleasure reading Kengan Ahura from time to time as well..</p>
							<h4>Video Games</h4>
							<p>Despite not actively playing videogames, I am still a part of the community and its fascinating seeing it grow as a form of media. My favourite videogame series that I've played through are Mother, Ace Attorney and Pokemon (although I don't like admitting it).</p>
							<p>As for standalone games and not entire series, I play a lot of Monster Hunter Generations. Currently playing Deus Ex and loving it.</p>

						<h3>Interests</h3>
						<p>Interested in learning Java, Python and about cybersecurity. I'd like to pursue a career in cybersecurity or artificial intelligence.</p>
						<p>Also interested in picking up violin and game development.</p>
						<div class="hidden extraContent">
							<p>I'm interested in learning more about quantum computing and quantum encryption and more on the topic of cybersecurity. I'm also a huge fan of randomly generated outputs, as seen in my random password generator, Steam Key generator, random colour generator and hopefully more to come. The next step is to obviously introduce rhyme and reason to the randomness, which is through artificial intelligence and machine learning. Ever since Google's Alpha Zero was able to win against StockFish 8 in Chess, I have wanted to make my own AI.</p>
							<p>From all the coding languages out there and aside from the one's previously mentioned; I'd like to learn TypeScript, SCALA, SQL, Go and Swift. As for human languages, I want to learn Spanish and basic Polish to get by living in Poland. I could only dream of learning German, French and Japanese as well but the mind can only focus on so many things at once.</p>
							<p>All that aside, I also want to learn philosophy, psychology and history to sound smart wherever I go. I'd like to learn video editing and animation as both of them are extremely useful tools. I also want to get better at my art so that I can be as good as Ilya Kushinov when it comes to drawing female faces and Takehiko Inoue when it comes to drawing male faces.</p>
							<p>Interested in creative writing as well, especially world building. It's a useful skill if I ever plan to create a full fledged video game. Drawing would also come in handy for concept art and pixel art.</p>
